# JobPlacement

## Introduction
The final two weeks of the Tech Academy were spent as a team with fellow peers, utilizing skills learns to  develop a fully functional MVC Web Application using C# language. It was a great opportunity to see how Scrum-style coding works and how important it is to be responsible when working in a team setting where everyone is dependent on each other. I worked with both [back end stories](#back-end-stories) and [front end stories](#front-end-stories) with varying degrees of difficulty. It was an opportunity to work on planning and developing code, fixing bugs, and utilizing resources available to progress the project. 

Below are code snippets and descriptions of code that I worked on with full files availabe in repo.
